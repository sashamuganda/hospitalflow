## 2024-05-22 - Implementing Route Guards in Flutter with GoRouter
**Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated access to sensitive clinical routes.
**Learning:** In Flutter applications using `go_router`, navigation-based authorization (route guarding) should be implemented using the `redirect` callback. It's critical to ensure the `AppState` (or any authentication state provider) is available in the `BuildContext` when the `GoRouter` instance attempts to read it. If `GoRouter` is initialized outside the `Provider` scope, `context.read<AppState>()` will fail.
**Prevention:** Wrap the `MaterialApp.router` with the necessary `Provider` in the `main.dart` file to ensure the authentication state is accessible globally during navigation transitions.

## 2024-06-12 - Hardening Clinical Input Lengths to Prevent DoS
**Vulnerability:** Missing `maxLength` constraints on critical clinical input fields (SOAP notes, chief complaints, vitals).
**Learning:** In a clinical environment, excessively large inputs in text fields can lead to application instability, memory exhaustion, or database performance degradation (Denial of Service). This app frequently suppresses the visual character counter using `counterText: ''` for aesthetic reasons, which can obscure the absence of underlying security constraints.
**Prevention:** Explicitly define `maxLength` for all `TextField` widgets accepting clinical data and include a `// Security: Limit input length to prevent DoS` comment to ensure the requirement is visible to future maintainers.

## 2024-10-24 - Implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in GoRouter
**Vulnerability:** Lack of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) on administrative routes (/analytics, /staff).
**Learning:** Authenticated users could bypass UI restrictions and access sensitive administrative features by manually navigating to the routes. Navigation-based authorization must be enforced centrally in the router's redirect callback.
**Prevention:** Implement an explicit role check in the `GoRouter` redirect callback. Cross-reference the current user's role against a list of restricted routes and fail-secure by redirecting unauthorized access to a safe default like the home screen.
